# Enhanced Electron App Size Optimizations ðŸš€

## Summary of Implemented Optimizations

The following optimizations have been implemented to reduce the Shortcut Shortcut Mac DMG size from 1.07GB to a more reasonable size.

### 1. Enhanced afterPack.js Script

The cleanup script has been significantly improved with:

- **More aggressive pattern matching** for removing unnecessary files
- **Targeted cleanup for large packages**:
  - @mui, @emotion, framer-motion, @rive-app, electron, etc.
- **Language file cleanup** (keeping only English)
- **Development tooling removal**:
  - TypeScript, Babel, Webpack, test frameworks
- **Source directory removal** when dist directories exist
- **Multiple cleanup passes** to ensure thorough file removal

### 2. Improved Electron Builder Configuration

Updated the electron-builder configuration in package.json with:

- **Enhanced file exclusion patterns** for better filtering
- **Maximum compression** setting for macOS builds
- **Removal of unnecessary build targets** (keeping only DMG)
- **Disabled npmRebuild** and **buildDependenciesFromSource** flags
- **Optimized DMG configuration** for better presentation

### 3. Webpack Optimization Enhancements

Improved the webpack configuration with:

- **Advanced Terser configuration** with multiple compression passes
- **Granular code splitting** for better chunk management:
  - React, Router, MUI, Emotion, Framer Motion, Rive, DnD Kit
- **Deterministic IDs** for better caching
- **Performance budgets** for better size monitoring
- **Tree-shaking improvements** with mainFields configuration

## Further Size Reduction Suggestions

If the build is still too large after these changes, consider:

1. **Analyze bundle size** with `yarn analyze` to identify remaining large modules
2. **Lazy-load non-critical components** using dynamic imports
3. **Review Rive animations** and optimize or lazy-load them
4. **Consider lighter alternatives** to heavy dependencies
5. **Move more dependencies to devDependencies** if they're not needed at runtime
6. **Electron native module optimization** - ensure only necessary Electron modules are included

## Testing the Build Size

After implementing these changes, you can check the new build size with:

```bash
yarn build:mac && du -sh release/mac/*.dmg
```

## Expected Results

These optimizations should reduce the DMG size significantly from the current 1.07GB. Based on similar Electron applications, a target size of 200-300MB should be achievable.

## Notes on Size Contributors

From our analysis, the primary size contributors were:

| Package | Size |
|---------|------|
| electron | 257MB |
| app-builder-bin | 207MB |
| @mui | 192MB |

Most of these are development dependencies that should now be properly excluded from the final build.
