# Shortcut-Shortcut Web App Refactoring - Phase 2 Implementation

This document details the implementation of Phase 2 of the web app refactoring plan, which focused on Storage Abstraction to enable both Electron and web environments to share a common data persistence layer.

## Implemented Files

1. **Storage Service Interface**
   - `src/renderer/services/storage/StorageService.ts` - Defines the common interface for storage operations

2. **Electron Storage Implementation**
   - `src/renderer/services/storage/ElectronStorageService.ts` - Implements storage service for Electron environment using electron-store

3. **IndexedDB Storage Implementation**
   - `src/renderer/services/storage/DexieStorageService.ts` - Implements storage service for Web environment using Dexie.js

4. **Template Storage Service**
   - `src/renderer/services/storage/TemplateStorage.ts` - Provides template-specific storage operations

5. **Cache Storage Service**
   - `src/renderer/services/storage/CacheStorage.ts` - Provides cache-specific storage operations

6. **Updated Context Providers**
   - `src/renderer/store/CacheContext.tsx.new` - Updated cache provider that uses the new storage abstraction
   - `src/renderer/store/SettingsContext.tsx.new` - Updated settings provider that uses the new storage abstraction

## Implementation Details

### Storage Service Interface

We defined a common interface for all storage operations:

```typescript
export interface StorageService {
  get<T>(key: string, defaultValue?: T): Promise<T>;
  set<T>(key: string, value: T): Promise<void>;
  has(key: string): Promise<boolean>;
  delete(key: string): Promise<void>;
  clear(): Promise<void>;
  getAll(): Promise<Record<string, any>>;
}
```

This interface abstracts the underlying storage mechanism, allowing us to switch between Electron's store and IndexedDB seamlessly.

### Environment-Specific Implementations

1. **Electron Implementation**
   - Wraps the existing electron-store IPC calls
   - Maps the common interface methods to appropriate IPC calls
   - Currently focuses on handling templates, with scaffolding for other data types

2. **IndexedDB Implementation with Dexie.js**
   - Uses Dexie.js to interact with IndexedDB
   - Defines a database schema with tables for templates and other data
   - Implements automatic migration from localStorage when available
   - Uses an in-memory cache to improve performance for frequently accessed data

### Higher-Level Storage Services

1. **Template Storage**
   - Provides template-specific operations (get, save, delete, import, export)
   - Uses the underlying storage abstraction for data persistence
   - Handles data validation and transformation

2. **Settings Storage**
   - Manages application settings
   - Implements migration from localStorage
   - Provides helper methods for common settings operations

3. **Cache Storage**
   - Implements a hybrid caching strategy:
     - In-memory cache for fast access
     - Persistent storage for durability across sessions
   - Handles cache invalidation and expiration

### Updated React Contexts

1. **Cache Context**
   - Updated to use the new CacheStorage service
   - Maintains the same API to minimize changes to consuming components
   - Implements synchronous wrapper methods for backward compatibility

2. **Settings Context**
   - Updated to use the new SettingsStorage service
   - Adds loading state to handle asynchronous operations
   - Uses the API service abstraction for token validation

## Design Decisions

### Using Dexie.js for IndexedDB Access

We chose Dexie.js for the following reasons:
1. Clean, promise-based API that works well with async/await
2. Strong TypeScript support with type safety
3. Built-in schema versioning for future migrations
4. Good performance characteristics

### Hybrid Memory/Persistent Caching

For the cache implementation, we used a hybrid approach:
1. In-memory cache for frequently accessed data (performance)
2. Persistent storage for durability across sessions
3. Automatic migration from existing in-memory-only cache

### Backward Compatibility

To maintain backward compatibility with existing code, we:
1. Kept the same context APIs (though underlying implementations changed)
2. Used synchronous wrapper methods that initiate async operations
3. Added migration code to move data from localStorage to our new storage system

### Data Schema

We designed the database schema to be:
1. Flexible - accommodating different types of data
2. Performant - with appropriate indices
3. Extensible - allowing for future additions

## Migration Strategy

The implementation includes automatic migration from existing storage:
1. On first use, check if data exists in localStorage
2. If data exists, migrate it to the new storage system
3. Continue using the new storage system for all operations

## Next Steps for Phase 3

The next phase will focus on updating the build system for web deployment:

1. **Update Webpack Configuration**
   - Modify webpack configuration to support web target
   - Create separate entry points for Electron and web
   - Configure environment variables for build targets

2. **Create Web-Specific Entry Point**
   - Implement a web-specific entry point that doesn't rely on Electron
   - Handle feature detection and graceful degradation

3. **Update Package Scripts**
   - Add scripts for building and deploying the web app
   - Configure development server for web-only development
